I am Nuo Chen (陈诺), a first-year PhD candidate of Mechanical Engineering at Dalhousie University, where I work on robotics control and machine learning with professor [Ya-Jun Pan](http://acm.me.dal.ca/). Prior to that, I received my M.A.Sc degree from Dalhousie University in Mechanical Engineering and B.Eng degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Robotics Engineering, advised by professor [Chenglong Fu](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/fuchenglong.html).
