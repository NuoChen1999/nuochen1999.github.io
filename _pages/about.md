I am a first-year PhD candidate of Mechanical Engineering at Dalhousie University, where I work on robotics control and machine learning with professor [Ya-Jun Pan] (http://acm.me.dal.ca/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Robotics Engineering. Advised by professor Chenglong Fu.
